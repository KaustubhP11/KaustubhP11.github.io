## About Me

I am Kaustubh Ponkshe, a researcher passionate about democratizing AI through trustworthy, efficient, and scalable machine learning systems. I hold a dual degree in Electrical Engineering and Artificial Intelligence from IIT Bombay, where I was awarded the Undergraduate Research Award for one of the best bachelorâ€™s theses.

My research focuses on addressing challenges in fine-tuning, federated learning, and privacy-preserving AI. Some of my notable projects include:
- **LoRA-SB**: Achieved up to 90x parameter efficiency while maintaining competitive performance in fine-tuning.
- **Power Learning**: Developed a privacy-preserving framework for collaborative learning with formal differential privacy guarantees.
- **StructFormer**: Proposed a novel structure-aware language model for document comprehension.

Feel free to explore my [publications](/publications/) and [projects](/projects/).
